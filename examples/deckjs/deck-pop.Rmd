## How to Make a Deck

1. <h3>Write Slides</h3>
   Slide content is simple HTML.
2. <h3>Choose Themes</h3>
   One for slide styles and one for deck transitions.
3. <h3>Include Extensions</h3>
   Add extra functionality to your deck, or leave it stripped down.

## Slides are just HTML elements with a class of slide.

```html
<section class="slide">
  <h2>How to Make a Deck</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Write Slides</h3>
      <p>Slide content is simple HTML.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Choose Themes</h3>
      <p>One for slide styles and one for deck transitions.</p>
    </li>
    â€¦
  </ol>
</section>
