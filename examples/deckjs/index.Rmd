## How to Make a Deck

1. <h3>Write Slides</h3>
   Slide content is simple HTML.
2. <h3>Choose Themes</h3>
   One for slide styles and one for deck transitions.
3. <h3>Include Extensions</h3>
   Add extra functionality to your deck, or leave it stripped down.

## Slides are just HTML elements with a class of slide.

```html
<section class="slide">
  <h2>How to Make a Deck</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Write Slides</h3>
      <p>Slide content is simple HTML.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Choose Themes</h3>
      <p>One for slide styles and one for deck transitions.</p>
    </li>
    …
  </ol>
</section>
```

## Style Themes

Customizes the colors, typography, and layout of slide content.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/css/style-theme.css">
```

## Transition Themes

Defines transitions between slides using CSS3 transitions. Less capable browsers fall back to cutaways. But you aren’t using those browsers to give your presentations, are you…

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/css/transition-theme.css">
```

## Extensions

Core gives you basic slide functionality with left and right arrow navigation, but you may want more. Here are the ones included in this deck:

> - deck.goto: Adds a shortcut key to jump to any slide number. Hit g, type in the slide number, and hit enter.
> - deck.hash: Enables internal linking within slides, deep linking to individual slides, and updates the address bar & a permalink anchor with each slide change.
> - deck.menu: Adds a menu view, letting you see all slides in a grid. Hit m to toggle to menu view, continue navigating your deck, and hit m to return to normal view. Touch devices can double-tap the deck to switch between views.
> - deck.navigation: Adds clickable left and right buttons for the less keyboard inclined.
> - deck.status: Adds a page number indicator. (current/total)

<p class='slide'>Each extension folder in the download package contains the necessary JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files. For a complete list of extension modules included in deck.js, check out the documentation.</p>
